//	This file is here so typescript imports would shut the fuck up.
//	Include appropriate component submodule instead.
//	Submodules: ./react, ./astro, ./vue

//	By the way, the imports are a bit broken... that's what working with Node looks like,
//	so if your project suddenly decided to fail importing somethin - check that youre
//	not trying to import a component from the package root.
//	The package root is it's cli tool, and at the moment it does not expose any API, and so this file remains empty
